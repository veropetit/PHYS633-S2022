# L22 Radiation pressure

Week 12, Thursday


## Material covered and references


Today we wil explore the pressure caused by radiation. We will follow the footsteps of Eddington by noting that the pressure of gas + radiation can be expressed as a polytrop if the ratio of Pgas/Ptot is constant.

(From this, it is possible to find an expression for the temperature structure (for a radiative zone, i.e. no convection). When compared with a more detailed MESA model for the Sun, it is not such a bad approximation!)
