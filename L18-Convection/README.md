# L18 Convection

Week 10, Thursday


## Material covered and references


* Is the energy always transported by radiation? 

We discuss the concept of convection, and develop a criteria to evaluate the stability of radiative energy transport. 

You will find a nice description of observational evidences of convection for the Sun in Mullan Chap.6


> In the [textbooks](../textbooks.md):
> 
>* Leblanc 5.3
>* Hansen 4.2.1 for the del_rad, Chap 5 for convection, but lot of details about the mixing length theory.
>* Kip chap 6 and 7
>* McDo chap 4
>* Mullan chap 6 and 7. Very interesting alternative approach based on thermodynamics.
