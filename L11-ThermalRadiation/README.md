# L11 Thermal Radiation

Week 6, Tuesday


## Material covered and references

Properties of "blackbodies" objects. From the energy distribution of photon inside of the BB cavity, we found:
* The total energy density
* The distribution of photon's frequency and wavelength (beware of the conversion)
* That the intensity of the light inside the cavity was equal to the Planck function
* that the flux inside of the cavity is zero
* that the flux at the surface of a BB (light going through the "hole") is <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\sigma T^4">.

* In the case of a pure thermal radiation at a single temperature, there is no change in intensity such that <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=I_\lambda=\S_\lambda=\B_\lambda">.
* But in the case of LTE, the temperature gradient means that the intensity I is not always B, if the source function changes within a few optical depths. However, locally the source function can be approximated by <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=S_\lambda=B_\lambda"> if scattering processes are much less important than pure absorption processes.

We explored the frequency dependence of the opacity and its effect on the frequency dependence of the intensity exiting a slab of material with <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=S_\lambda=B_\lambda(T)">. We can link these with the type of spectra described by the Kirchhoff's law of spectroscopy.
