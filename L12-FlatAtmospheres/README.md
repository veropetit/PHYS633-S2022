# L12 Flat Atmospheres

Week 6, Thursday


## Material covered and references

We applied the formal solution of RT to a semi-infinite, flat atmosphere. We found an expression for the in-going (u<0) and out-going (u>0) rays. 
In the case of the Sun, we are able to measure the emergent intensity (tau = 0) as a function of u. This can therefore be used to constrain the source function and hence the temperature.
